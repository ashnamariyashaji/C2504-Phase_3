INTRODUCTION
Platform level integration is a common terminology used in healthcare IT practice to describe a system that does not connect
to any applications or devices of other vendors and need not follow any standards. Integrating these systems with any third
party applications poses a major challenge in today’s healthcare enterprise.
IHE provides a framework for standards-based integration. IHE is a joint initiative of the Radiological Society of North America
(RSNA) and the healthcare information and Management systems Society (HIMSS). It aims to develop a framework to ease the
integration of, and information flow between, various medical information systems with the ultimate goal of ensuring that all
required clinical information is correct and readily available to the relevant users. Currently, interfacing systems can be difficult
due to the different standards – and implementation of those standards – employed by such systems. IHE aims to define how
existing standards may be used in order to facilitate communication between computer systems used in healthcare.
PRESENT SCENARIO
Figure 1 shows the various information systems and modalities in the traditional healthcare environment where HIS-RIS and
PACS are not integrated. In general, Patient information system performs the patient registration, admission, transfer; order
placing, billing and discharge of patient in a typical hospital environment.
The radiology information system performs tasks related to radiology department such as order filling, patient/examination
scheduling etc. With respect to images, the imaging modalities generate images and then the images would be archived on the
PACS. Archived images can be later reviewed or distributed to other departments. Entities within each of these systems
communicate with each other using various medical standards such as health level 7(HL7) or digital imaging and communications
in medicine (DICOM).
Patient information system uses HL7 protocol in-order to transfer patient demographics, patient/exam scheduled details, and
other patient related information, to the radiology information system. Similarly, PACS, modality and review stations use DICOM
for storing and querying images between these systems.
However communication between the systems (HIS and PACS) is either paper based or film based as shown in Figure 1.

DRAWBACKS
RIS receives the patient demographics and ADT (admission, discharge and transmission) related data. Along with patient data,
RIS also contains patient/exam scheduling details which is required by PACS/Modality. Exchange of relevant information
between HIS and PACS/Modality is paper/film based as we see in Figure 1. This could lead to a number of drawbacks.
• The critical patient-related data must be re-entered manually into these systems
• Discrepancies in re-entering data manually, would negatively impact the efficiency and productivity
• Time consuming
• Cost overhead due to paper and film based transactions
• Difficulty in obtaining and maintaining old films/reports
NEED FOR HIS-RIS-PACS INTEGRATION
The whole healthcare enterprise involves number of disparate resources and information systems (refer Figure 1). In order to
provide the best possible patient care, information from all resources should be utilized. However, the ability of the various systems
to effectively communicate with each other is often lacking. Integrating the healthcare enterprise (IHE) seeks to promote
effective communication between information systems in order to aid efficient and economic healthcare.

PACS broker acts as an interpreter of patient information across HIS and PACS. Ideally RIS schedules patient’s radiology
procedures, which would be required by Modality to perform the scheduled procedures. PACS broker translates HL7 messages
to DICOM, which enables the PACS/Modality to understand the patient related information and store it locally. Similarly, RIS
needs to be updated with performed procedure status from the Modality. In this case PACS broker translates DICOM to HL7
message, which would be interpreted by RIS and then stored in local HIS/RIS database. PACS broker bridges gap between HIS
and PACS/Modality by providing electronic means of patient data exchange and avoiding manual re-entry of data.
Benefits of such an integrated healthcare enterprise would account for:
• Improved clinical workflow
• Improved information accuracy
• Enabling of cross-system functionality
• Improved information availability
A SOLUTION FRAMEWORK
The scheduled workflow integration profile establishes the continuity and integrity of basic departmental imaging data
acquired in an environment where examinations are generally being ordered. It specifies a number of transactions that
maintain the consistency of patient and ordering information as well as defining the scheduling and imaging acquisition
procedure steps.
The IHE implementation architecture for the scheduled workflow Integration profile considers the following actors for
implementation
• The order filler
• Evidence creator
• Archive manager
• Image viewer
• PPS manager
These actors along with the actors ADT, acquisition Modality and order placer and their transactions, as described in IHE, are
taken into consideration for the proposed framework. The data flow between actors is either in the form of HL7 message or
DICOM messages.

The framework for implementing scheduled workflow integration profile can be seen Figure 3.
Figure 3: Scheduled Workflow
The architecture assumes that ADT and order placer actors (typically a part of HIS) are in place. These applications send data in
HL7 format to the order filler system. The ADT sends out patient related data and the order placer sends order related data like
order creation, order cancellation, order update etc.
The order filler system receives the HL7 formatted data and commits it to the repository so that this data can be used for
responding to the MWM query from the acquisition modality. The order filler system schedules the procedures and communicates
status updates to the order placer.
The archive manager acts as the image store. The images are pushed to the archive manager through DICOM from acquisition
modality and evidence creator system. The archive manager also runs the query retrieve service for the image viewer.
The evidence creator system communicates with the performed procedure step manager system and the archive manager. It
communicates the status of the order to the performed procedure step manager. The system communicates the storage
commitment and transfers the images to the archive manager.
The ‘performed procedure step manager’ forwards the ‘procedure step-in progress’ and ‘procedure step completed DICOM
messages’ to the archive manager system and the order filler system. Thus it implements both MPPS SCU and SCP services.
The image viewer system is a user interface for viewing and minimal post processing on the images. The image viewer queries
for images from the archive manager system and displays the retrieved images.

Order Filler System
This sub system fills the request or order raised by the order placing system and acts as an interface between information
systems in a healthcare setup (like HIS, RIS) and the acquisition modalities. It interfaces with the information systems through
HL7 protocol.
The modular representation of this sub-system can be depicted as follows:
Figure 4: Order filler system
HL7 broker sub system
This module takes care of the reception and transmission of HL7 data from external systems. The messages are received,
decoded and committed to a data store. Various inputs and outputs for a typical HL7 broker are as shown in Figure 5.

 THE METHODOLOGY USED
Integration of stand alone hospital information system (HIS), radiology information system (RIS) with picture archiving and
communication system (PACS) can be achieved by following a five step process. This would help in implementing the proposed
framework (scheduled workflow integration profile) for an integrated healthcare enterprise.
The necessary steps to be followed are
• Readiness check
• Data mapping
• Prototyping
• Customization and implementation
• Dry run and testing

Scenario
The HIS captures and manages Patient related data. The Patient related data includes patient registration, inpatient admit,
outpatient admit, patient transfer and patient discharge.
The RIS acts as the order placing system. The responsibilities of the RIS includes creation of new orders, updating the order
related data and cancellation of orders. The procedure related data is captured as a part of the order entry process.
PACS is used in the radiology department for acquisition of medical image, data transmission of medical data and images via
a network; display and manipulation of medical images and archiving of image data;
HIS, RIS and PACS systems are not integrated, however the information systems are HL7 and DICOM compliant. Scenario can be
depicted graphically as shown in figure 1.
Solution
The PACS broker functionality bridges the gap between HIS –RIS and the modality by taking data from HIS-RIS in HL7 format.
The PACS broker functionality also provides MWM SCP service to the modality and receives performed procedure step status
updates (refer the proposed framework). The PACS broker functionality can reside on an independent hardware (broker) or on
PACS/RIS (broker less solution).

Prerequisites
• HIS-RIS are HL7 compliant. This translates in to ability of the information systems to communicate patient and order
centric data in HL7 format with other systems. The mode of communication (TCP/IP, HTTP and FTP) may be defined by the
vendors. The content of the HL7 messages may be in ASCII text or in XML, though the latter is widely used.
• Modality is DICOM compliant. This defines the ability of the Modality to run DICOM services and communicate with other
DICOM applications to exchange imaging data.
Readiness Check
There are some issues that need to be addressed for a successful integration. These can be classified in to
• RIS-PACS capabilities
• Modality readiness (DICOM compliance)
• Workflow changes
Gap analysis would examine the existing system from functional and technical perspective based on the parameters (issues)
mentioned above. The functional perspective would provide insights into the integration requirements of existing systems as
per IHE standards. The technical perspective would delve into issues dealing with technology such as integration of various
systems on different platforms, transport mechanism, security requirements etc.
Data Mapping
The mapping of fields to DICOM tags is governed by the conformance statement of the modality. The usage of codes as
described in standards for fields (LOINC, ICD Code defined in HL7) must be determined. The mapping of local/site-specific codes
to standard defined codes can be done on the broker or in the existing applications. This can be mutually decided.
Prototyping
The prototyping is done to demonstrate the changes in workflow due to the implementation of scheduled workflow integration
profile. This also provides an opportunity to review the integration process as a whole from the perspective of all the vendors.
Customization/implementation
Customization is needed as there is disparity in the way the standards - HL7 and DICOM - treat the data .For example, the
accession number is a unique identifier in the Modality , while HIS-RIS might not generate it at all. So the configuration module
would make use of a unique transaction ID generated in the system.
Similarly DICOM services need to be configured as per the conformance statements of the Modality vendors. The module will
also make provisions for future enhancements of the system.

Dry Run and Testing
The individual modules are tested by a cycle of unit testing by writing stubs. The integration testing is done after other
applications are setup. All the possible work flows would be tested during the dry run. The end of this cycle signals the
implementation of integrated environment of Modality and the information systems.
ARCHITECTURE
The architecture for implementing the order filler actor should be arrived at by considering the following criteria.
Cross platform support: Cross platform support: The implementation should be compatible with multiple platforms. This would allow easy deployment
of the solution irrespective of the target platform. This calls for a middleware with common system interface which would
implement OS specific system calls. The solution should be customizable by compiling the source code for a particular OS.
Distributed: stributed: stributed: The solution should be modular with each of the modules realizing unit functionality. These modules should have
the capability of being distributed across machines if need arises for such a deployment.
Scalable: Scalable: The solution should be capable of handling varying amount of traffic from the peer applications. The solution should Scalable:
have load balancing mechanisms in place so that performance can be tuned as per requirement and large amount of transactions
can be handled per unit of time.
Configurable: Configurable: Configurable: The various modules comprising the solution should be configurable. These configurations such as peer application
name, IP address, supported TAGS, supported HL7 fields, HL7 messages etc can be provided through a text file interface. These
fields/TAGS defined in the standards (HL7 and DICOM) can be mapped to the database of the order filler using configuration
files for seamless integration of applications with the order filler.
The other key issues considered while arriving at the architecture and design are
• Secure exchange of information
• Variety of message transport protocols supported (TCP/IP, FTP, HTTP)
• Support for message oriented middleware
• Traceability of transactions (logging facility)
• Use of XML format of HL7 data exchange
CONCLUSION
The Integrated Healthcare Enterprise that implements scheduled workflow Integration profile results in improved clinical
workflow, improved information accuracy and improved information availability.
The advantages of implementing the order filler (key component of schedule workflow integration profile) as per the
recommended methodology would help keep the system scalable and configurable which would essentially result in speedy
implementation and reduced time-to-market.
